## How to Contribute

If you want to help us document, open a PR with changes to the __SwiftUI.swift__ file. 

Documentation additions should be written directly in the comment blocks of the file using the standard [Apple Markup Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016497-CH2-SW1). 

It's really important to follow the [Documentation Template](https://github.com/BananaDocs/BananaDocs/wiki/Documentation-Template) when making any changes. 

This is a great example of a fully documented page: [Button Style](https://github.com/BananaDocs/BananaDocs/wiki/ButtonStyle-Documentation-Example)

If you want to see the current status of documentation, check out [BananaDocs](https://bananadocs.org)

We're super excited by the possibility of fully community maintained documentation website üòÑ
