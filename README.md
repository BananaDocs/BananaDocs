# BananaDocs
SwiftUI Documentation Project 

This project is a massive undertaking! Our dream is for this to be a fully community maintained project ‚Äì where the community earns 100% of their bananaüçå work.
If you want to help us document, open a PR with changes. 

If you want to see the current status of documentation, feel free to check out [BananaDocs](https://bananadocs.org)

It's really important to follow the [Documentation Template](https://github.com/BananaDocs/BananaDocs/wiki/Documentation-Template) when making any changes. 

We're really excited to provide this for the community and hope to finish documenting with your help!!
